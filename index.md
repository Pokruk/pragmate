# Welcome to **Tag Strike**!

Unlike other games, **Tag Strike** is built on dedicated servers, which opens up a wide range of benefits and opportunities for both players and server hosts.

### Immediate Benefits:

- **Less Lag**: With dedicated servers, players experience significantly lower latency. Unlike other games, where performance can drop when many players join a lobby, **Tag Strike** ensures stable FPS and smooth gameplay, even with dozens of players.

- **Perfectly Recreated Physics**: We’ve carefully replicated the familiar physics from other similar games, so players can immediately feel comfortable with the movement mechanics they’ve come to love.

- **Automatic Round Timekeeping**: Our game features automatic time tracking and round counters, providing a seamless and organized gaming experience.

- **Unlimited Player Capacity**: With our server-based architecture, there is essentially no limit to the number of players a server can handle. This allows for massive meetups and in-game events with large numbers of participants, something that peer-to-peer networks often struggle with.

### Future Possibilities Thanks to Dedicated Servers:

With dedicated servers, we plan to introduce several new features that will further enhance the game:

- **Player-Hosted Servers**: In the future, players will have the ability to host their own servers. This brings many benefits:
    - **Near-Zero Latency**: Players can set up servers in their own region, allowing for almost zero latency for themselves and nearby friends.
    - **Faster Moderation**: Server admins will be able to ban cheaters or toxic players instantly, making moderation quicker than relying on a report system.
    - **Custom Rules**: Players can create and enforce their own server rules, adding variety and flexibility to the game.
    - **More Opportunities for Modders**: The server-based architecture gives modders more creative freedom, allowing them to implement more complex modifications.
    - **Lower Hosting Costs**: Because we don’t require a full client to run, like in peer-to-peer games, server hosting will be much more affordable. This means more servers with lower costs for players.

- **Custom Maps**: We plan to give server admins the ability to host custom maps, making the gameplay even more diverse and exciting.

- **Ranking and Matchmaking System**: A reliable ranking system and skill-based matchmaking are in the works, ensuring fairer competition and rewarding skilled players.

- **Advanced Anti-Cheat System**: Thanks to our server architecture, we will be able to implement a robust anti-cheat system, providing strong protection against cheaters and ensuring a fair playing field.

- **Replay System**: A replay system is also planned, and because of our well-built server infrastructure, implementing this feature will be much easier than in other games of this type.

With **Tag Strike**, you get a smoother, more customizable, and fairer multiplayer experience. Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to develop the game and add even more exciting features!
